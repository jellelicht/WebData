	trying to lead quiet lives. Cowboys try to make a 
	living. Sheriff 'Little Bill' tries to build a 
	house and keep a heavy-handed order. The town 
	whores just try to get by.Then a couple of cowboys 
	cut up a whore. Unsatisfied with Bill's justice, 
	the prostitutes put a bounty on the cowboys. The 
	bounty attracts a young gun billing himself as 
	'The Schofield Kid', and aging killer William 
	Munny. Munny reformed for his young wife, and has 
	been raising crops and two children in peace. But 
	his wife is gone. Farm life is hard. And Munny is

	saddles his ornery nag, and rides off to kill one 
	more time, blurring the lines between heroism and 
	villainy, man and myth.</summary>
