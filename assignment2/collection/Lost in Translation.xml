    <summary>Bob Harris is an American film actor, far past his 
	prime. He visits Tokyo to appear in commercials, 
	and he meets Charlotte, the young wife of a 
	visiting photographer. Bored and weary, Bob and 
	Charlotte make ideal if improbable traveling 
	companions. Charlotte is looking for &quot;her place in 
	life,&quot; and Bob is tolerating a mediocre stateside 
	marriage. Both separately and together, they live 
	the experience of the American in Tokyo. Bob and 
	Charlotte suffer both confusion and hilarity due 
	to the cultural and language differences between 
	themselves and the Japanese. As the relationship 
	between Bob and Charlotte deepens, they come to 
	the realization that their visits to Japan, and 
	one another, must soon end. Or must they?</summary>
