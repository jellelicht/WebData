    <summary>Hunters and their prey--Neil and his professional 
	criminal crew hunt to score big money targets 
	(banks, vaults, armored cars) and are, in turn, 
	hunted by Lt. Vincent Hanna and his team of cops 
	in the Robbery/Homicide police division. A botched 
	job puts Hanna onto their trail while they regroup 
	and try to put together one last big 'retirement' 
	score. Neil and Vincent are similar in many ways, 
	including their troubled personal lives. At a 
	crucial moment in his life, Neil disobeys the 
	dictum taught to him long ago by his criminal 
	mentor--'Never have anything in your life that you 
	can't walk out on in thirty seconds flat, if you 
	spot the heat coming around the corner'--as he 
	falls in love. Thus the stage is set for the 
	suspenseful ending.... </summary>
